Project #1: Build a Keylogger
A keylogger is a program that is used to capture the keystrokes from users keyboard. The user types on the infected 
device, and then the keylogger sends that information to a 3rd party. While the program itself is not malicious 
it can be used for malicious purposes so make sure that you get permisson from the compture before testing.  

# First we need to create a keylooger inside Kaile we will add meterpreter shell, which well allow us to establish a 
connection to another system in order to run the keylogger.
